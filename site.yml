# Run this like so:
# ansible-playbook site.yml

# To only run this for planningalerts:
# ansible-playbook site.yml -l planningalerts

# To only run this for openaustralia:
# ansible-playbook site.yml -l openaustralia

# To show the value of an encrypted variable:
# ansible planningalerts -m debug -a 'var=planningalerts_production_mysql_password'

# Use terraform (see terraform directory) to actually provision ec2 infrastructure
