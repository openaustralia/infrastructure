## FIRST: edit the `vault_identity_list` in ``ansible.cfg``
# and make sure  you have all the password files you need.

## THEN

# Run this like so:
# ansible-playbook site.yml

# To only run this for planningalerts:
# ansible-playbook site.yml -l planningalerts

# To only run this for openaustralia:
# ansible-playbook site.yml -l openaustralia

# To show the value of an encrypted variable:
# ansible planningalerts -m debug -a 'var=mysql_password_production'
# Note that some values are different in development
# ansible development -m debug -a 'var=rds_admin_password'
#
# To encrypt a variable to the default vault id (requires ansible >=2.5.0):
#   ansible-vault encrypt_string --encrypt-vault-id default --name name secret
# To encrypt a variable to the EC2 vault id:
#   ansible-vault encrypt_string --encrypt-vault-id ec2 --name name secret
# See ansible.cfg for notes about which vault id to use.

# Use terraform (see terraform directory) to actually provision ec2 infrastructure

# Ubuntu 16.04 LTS doesn't come with python pre-installed. We need that for
# Ansible to work (for the gather facts). So install python first
